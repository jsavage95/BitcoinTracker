# BTCPriceTracker
C++ module for Arduino hardware displaying a BTC ticker and price

This very simple mini project was my attempt to build my own version of the very cool price trackers I had seen on amazon.
This uses a Arduino UNO R4 WiFi Development board, and a 2 x 16 LCD controller display.

The controller plugs directly into the Arduino, so no wires or soldering required!

Long term the goal is to 3D print my own case for it to make it more pleasing to eye ^_^
